# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

We have seen the application for the chain of fast-casual restaurants such as [Chipotle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chipotle-fresh-food-fast/id327228455), which allows users to check the menu and place an order. However, it is currently inconvenient for people to view the menus of food trucks, and order online. Thus, we plan to design an app to enable users to check the menus of food trucks online and allow the truck owners to manage their data on that website. 


## User stories

As a customer, I want to know what is on the menu of a certain food truck.

As a customer, I want to place orders of food trucks online.

As a food truck owner, I want to update the items on the menu
